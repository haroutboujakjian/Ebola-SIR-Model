# Ebola Model
This repo contains the MATLAB code I wrote when I published my Ebola SIR model paper. MATLAB was the primary language that I was using at the time. Although MATLAB is not open source, I thought it would be best to upload the files to github and let people look through the code if they please. Looking back, it would have been a lot easier to do this analysis in Python. 

The code was last updated __*January 2016*__.
